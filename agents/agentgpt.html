    <h2>What is AgentGPT?</h2>
    <p>
      AgentGPT is an advanced autonomous AI agent designed to execute multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. By combining state-of-the-art language models with an innovative task management framework, AgentGPT can break down high-level objectives into manageable actions and execute them seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike conventional chatbots, AgentGPT not only responds to prompts but also actively plans, prioritizes, and adjusts its workflow in real time. This makes it an ideal tool for developers, researchers, and businesses looking to enhance productivity through automation.
