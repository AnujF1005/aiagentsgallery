    <h2>What is AutoGPT?</h2>
    <p>
      AutoGPT stands for <em>Automatic Generative Pre-trained Transformer</em> – an open-source Python program that leverages powerful language models (such as GPT-4) to autonomously complete tasks. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on continuous user prompts, AutoGPT can break down a high-level goal into a series of smaller tasks and execute them with little to no human guidance.

    <h2>How Does AutoGPT Work?</h2>
    <p>
      AutoGPT works by chaining together a series of tasks and intelligently managing memory to achieve a broader goal. Its key capabilities include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Task Chaining:</strong> Breaking down complex objectives into smaller, manageable tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Utilizing both short-term and long-term memory to track context and improve output.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> Accessing real-time data from the web to refine responses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These features allow AutoGPT to function as an autonomous agent that can research, code, write, and even analyze data without constant human input.
