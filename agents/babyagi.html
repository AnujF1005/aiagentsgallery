    <h2>What is BabyAGI?</h2>
    <p>
      BabyAGI is an experimental framework for creating self-building autonomous agents. Developed by Yohei Nakajima, this open‐source project leverages the power of large language models (such as GPT-4) along with vector databases (like Pinecone) to automatically generate, prioritize, and execute tasks. The idea is to build the simplest agent that can iteratively improve itself through task planning and execution.

      Although still in its experimental phase, BabyAGI is sparking discussions and inspiring developers to explore the frontiers of autonomous AI. Its unique design blends human-like cognitive processes with automated code generation and task management.
