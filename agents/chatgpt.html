      <h2>What is ChatGPT?</h2>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is an advanced AI language model that uses deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text. At its core, ChatGPT is built upon the transformer architecture—a neural network design that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. It is capable of engaging in conversation, answering questions, writing essays, generating creative content, and even helping with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underlying technology that powers ChatGPT has been trained on a vast corpus of text data, allowing it to develop a nuanced understanding of language. This training enables the model to predict the next word in a sequence, making it incredibly effective at mimicking human conversation.

      <h2>How Does ChatGPT Work?</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of ChatGPT is the transformer architecture. This design allows the model to process input text in parallel, making it both efficient and effective at handling long-range dependencies in language. The model is pre-trained on a diverse dataset that includes books, articles, and web content, and then fine-tuned to refine its conversational abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process involves two key stages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pre-training:</strong> ChatGPT learns general language patterns from a massive dataset. During this stage, the model is exposed to a broad range of topics and writing styles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> The model is further refined using specific datasets that are carefully curated for conversational relevance. This stage helps tailor the responses to be more accurate and context-aware.
        </li>
      </ul>
